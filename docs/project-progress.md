# Flappy Bird Game Project Progress

## Architecture Review (Initial Assessment)

### Overall Structure
The project implements a Flappy Bird clone using TypeScript and HTML Canvas. The codebase follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns.

### Strengths
- **Game Loop Implementation**: Uses a professional fixed timestep pattern that decouples physics updates from rendering, ensuring consistent gameplay across different devices.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Properly uses singletons for global managers (GameLoop, ResourceManager, ScoreManager).
- **Entity System**: Implements a clean entity-based architecture with the IGameEntity interface.
- **Resource Management**: Handles asset loading efficiently with proper error handling.
- **Type Safety**: Uses TypeScript with strict typings and no 'any' types.
- **Physics Simulation**: Implements basic physics with velocity and acceleration.
- **Collision Detection**: Has dedicated collision handlers for game mechanics.
- **External Dependencies**: Uses external packages like @spithacode/input-manager to leverage existing solutions.
- **Clean Module Organization**: Input management is centralized and initialized in the main entry point.
- **Score System**: Implements a score system that tracks player progress and displays it on screen.

### Areas for Improvement
- **State Management**: Could benefit from a formal game state system to handle different screens (menu, game, game over).
- **Configuration**: Game constants are scattered throughout the code; could be centralized.
- **Audio Management**: Basic audio handling could be improved with a dedicated audio manager.
- **Component System**: Could evolve the entity system into a more flexible component-based system.
- **Code Organization**: Some files have multiple responsibilities; could benefit from further modularization.
- **Testing**: No evidence of unit tests or testing framework.

### Next Steps
1. Implement a proper game state management system
2. Create a configuration module for game constants
3. Enhance the entity system with a component-based approach
4. Implement a dedicated audio manager
5. Add unit tests for core game mechanics
6. Consider adding a UI layer for menus and game information

## Current Implementation Status
- Basic game loop: ✅
- Bird entity with physics: ✅
- Pipe generation and movement: ✅
- Collision detection: ✅
- Resource loading: ✅
- Input handling: ✅ (Using @spithacode/input-manager, centralized in main.ts)
- Game over conditions: ✅
- Score tracking: ✅
- Game states (menu, gameplay, game over): ❌
- Audio manager: ❌
- UI system: ❌

## Recent Changes
- **2024-??-??**: Added a score system that tracks when the bird passes through pipes and displays the current score on screen.
- **2024-??-??**: Improved input handling architecture. Moved InputManager initialization to main.ts and created a dedicated input.ts module to avoid circular dependencies.
